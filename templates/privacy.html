                        <h4>Use Of Google Analytics</h4>
                        <p>Our website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service by Google Inc. (hereafter: Google). Google Analytics uses cookies, text files that are saved to your computer and that facilitate the analysis of website use. The information about your use of this website created by the cookie is generally transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. As IP anonymisation is activated on this website, your IP address will be shortened by Google before leaving the European Union or European Economic Area. In exceptional cases, the full IP address will be transferred to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. On behalf of the website operator, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to create reports about website activities and provide other services for the website operator related to use of the website and the internet. The IP address transferred from your browser to Google will not be combined with any other Google data.
                        </p>
                        <p>You can prevent the storage of cookies by altering your browser software settings; we must make you aware, however, that you may not be able to use all website functions if you do so. You can also prevent Google from collecting the data created by the cookies about your use of the website (including your IP address) and from processing this data by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available using the following link: browser add-on to deactivate Google Analytics.
                        </p>
                        <p>Alternatively, or in addition to the browser add-on, you can prevent Google Analytics from tracking on our website by clicking on the following link.

                        <p>Our website uses Google conversion tracking. If you click on a Google ad on our website, Google Adwords will place a cookie on your computer. The conversion tracking cookie is used when a user clicks on a Google ad. These cookies expire after 30 days and are not used for personal identification. If the user visits certain pages of our website and the cookie is still valid, we and Google can identify that the user has clicked on the ad and been forwarded to this page. Each Google AdWords customer receives a different cookie. Cookies can therefore not be tracked via the websites of AdWords customers. The information collected using the conversion cookies serves to create conversion statistics for AdWords customers that have opted for conversion tracking. The customers find out the total number of users that have clicked on their ads and been forwarded to the intended page with a conversion tracking tag. They do not receive any information that can be used to personally identify users.

                        <p>When you visit a page on our website that contains any such plug-in, your browser creates a direct connection to the servers of Facebook, Google, Twitter or Instagram. The content of the plug-in will be transferred directly to your browser from the relevant provider and connected to the page. By connecting to the plug-in, the provider is informed that your browser has accessed the relevant page of our website even if you do not have a profile or are currently logged out of your profile. This information (including your IP address) will be transferred from your browser directly to a server of the relevant provider in the USA and stored there. If you logged into one of the services, the provider can allocate your visit to our website to your profile on Facebook, Google+, Twitter and/or Instagram. When you interact with the plug-ins, such as by clicking ‘Like’, ‘+1’, ‘Tweet’ or the ‘Instagram’ button, the relevant information will be transferred directly to the provider’s server and stored there. The information will be published on the social network, on your Twitter/Instagram account and shown to your contacts there.
